# Go DB Demo

A **demo Go project** for learning how to build simple **console and web CRUD applications**, using:

- [`sqlx`](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) for SQL database access with struct mapping
- [`gin`](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) for lightweight HTTP web framework
- PostgreSQL as the database

## What this project is

A **personal learning project** to explore:

- Structuring a Go application with `internal` packages
- Using `sqlx` for easy, type-safe database interactions
- Building a simple **console CLI** to manage users and organizations
- Adding a basic **REST API** using `gin` to serve the same data
- Managing database migrations with [`golang-migrate`](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
